Project Overview:

This project delves into the Tower Defense genre, focusing on optimising and balancing gameplay, the essential elements that make the Bloons Tower Defense series engaging and compelling. The Bloons 
TD franchise has had many years and iterations of games to balance mechanics and slowly add more. We want to experience this balancing process that the developers have had to go through. Our goal was to make a 
game that feels as close to bloons as possible. In this game, players use different towers that have different abilities , weapons, gadgets and magical powers to destroy different types of balloons, 
referred to as “Bloons".
The following are the main system we focused on :

-Tower Placement System.
-Upgrade System.
-Bloons Type System.
-Resource-Management System[also works with the stats tracking 
system]

The Team:
1. Dumi M. Mofolo =  dealt with the Tower Placement Systems and /or Resource Management system. 
2. Christopher J. Ridley = dealt with the Towers Upgrade inventory in depth and level expansion/paths. Also dealt with individual  tower systems.
3. Kellen Strydom = dealt with the Bloons System specifically the optimization of the Bloon Hit calculations and spawn rates.

Considering each team member dealth with a specifc system of the game, all members contributed to the programming, UI design and communication design of each system , which ended up being synced to make one cohesive game.

For more info on the design decisions that were made for this project, please have a read at the Game Design Document attached.
